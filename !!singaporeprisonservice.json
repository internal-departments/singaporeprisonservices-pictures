        "caption": "lovewins youareenoughThis March 8th, International Womens Day, I was invited to speak at Changi Female Prison. I brought my mum, making her dream come trueto return not as a prisoner, but as a beacon of hope. Mum was incarcerated in Changi from the mid-70s to 1983 for drug offenses. She turned her life around, living drug-free for decades. Her presence that day was a powerful message: *Its never too late to change. You are enough.* The inmates asked raw, valid questions about change and forgiveness. Mums life was the answerproof that no matter how far you fall, you can rise again. This day also reminded me of my familys 30-year journey to reconciliation. My parents divorced, and Dad remarried, but by Gods grace and effort, weve built a close-knit family. I adore my step-siblings, Adam and Andrea, and cherish the love we share. Ive been blessed with an incredible support systemmy overprotective brother, Spencer, who stepped up as a parent, my amazing aunties, uncles, and my Granny, who taught me, *Nothing is impossible, and family is worth fighting for.* To the ladies at Changi: Keep the faith. Believe in yourselves. Your past doesnt define your future. Never give up. And to anyone reading: Family and love are worth fighting for. Healing is possible. Grateful to AGAPE and Changi Prison for this meaningful opportunity. Forgiveness Reconciliation SecondChances Hope Family NeverGiveUp LoveWins"

She turned her life around, living drug-free for decades. Her presence that day was a powerful message: *Its never too late to change.

While prosocial support is a key aspect in the desistance journey, the networking and collaboration amongst Desistor Network member agencies will also provide other opportunities, such as community service, training to become mentors and employment opportunities, to strengthen the ex-offenders desistance efforts. Successful desistors who are SPS volunteers and befrienders may also be assigned as mentors for the inmates to provide them with the support required in their rehabilitation journey. As we count down to the upcoming launch of the Desistor Network in April 2023, stay tuned and follow us to learn more about this new initiative!

        "caption": "DidYouKnow? Just like students in mainstream schools, inmate students from the Prison School take their national examinations during the same period as them nationwide. On 17 February 2023, 16 inmate students received their GCE 'A' Level examination results. Among the 16 students who received their results was 'Jake', who is serving a 14-year sentence for drug-related offences. Motivated by the success stories of fellow ex-offenders, 'Jake' decided to pursue his education behind bars. The 29-year-old shared, \"I never enjoyed studying, but I found the strength to persevere because of my parents' support. They always told me the results do not matter as long as I did my best. It was stressful, but I coped by playing basketball and sharing jokes with other inmates.\" 'Jake' was pleasantly surprised that he scored a 'C' for his weakest subject, H1 Mathematics, contrary to the 'F' he received during his preliminary examinations.Mr Tan Teck Khiang, a Principles of Accounts (POA) teacher at Prison School, would often go the extra mile for 'Jake' and other inmate students by preparing additional teaching materials to supplement their lesson plans. He hopes that all inmate students continue to do their best after release and apply the accounting principles taught in their daily lives.

        "caption": "The Looking Forward (LF) Programme is a group-based motivational programme conducted by uniformed prison officers from the Singapore Prison Service for newly admitted inmates. LF Programme aims to ignite inmates motivation for change. Officers engage inmates in meaningful conversations on how to live a life according to their values and roles while navigating their prison sentence. Unlike most psychology-based correctional programmes, LF Programme is conducted by trained prison officers who are Correctional Unit Officers and they are supported by a specialist from the Psychological and Correctional Rehabilitation Division. During the LF Programme, inmates will better understand their strengths and weaknesses, learn skills to make better decisions, and be guided to take proactive steps in setting positive goals for their rehabilitation journey.

CW Azhar's curiosity to learn about the work of a Prison Officer led him to join the Singapore Prison Service (SPS) in 1998.As a Correctional Unit Officer, CW Azhar oversees the secure custody of inmates and rehabilitate them to become responsible citizens. He is also the Assistant Team Leader of 'Aspire Wing', a specialised unit which supervises inmates with persistent disruptive behaviours.CW Azhar also conducts Restorative Practices training, an engagement and reflection process where inmates learn to manage their emotions and take ownership of their actions as part of their rehabilitation journey.Despite the challenges he faces in his duty, CW Azhar finds it all worthwhile when inmates successfully rehabilitate and reintegrate into society.\"I would always advise inmates to have faith and hold on to hope. Having them think about the special people in their lives can help strengthen their resolve to change for the better.\"Outside of his work, CW Azhar enjoys flying drones to capture aerial photography and videography. He also occasionally races drones with a drone racing community!BehindPrisonWalls BeyondPrisonWall"

As a Trans-Tech Sustainment Officer in the Transformation & Technology Division, CW Umaparen assists and guides users in IT-related matters to ensure smooth operations. Having started his journey with the Singapore Prison Service in October 1996, he will soon mark his 26th year in service! Looking back at his long and fruitful career, CW Umaparen vividly recalls his time at the Kaki Bukit Centre - Prison School, which made him realise the important role of CaptainsOfLives in the rehabilitation of inmates. \"A few inmates were keen to pursue their degree after their release and I encouraged them to set it as their personal goal and to take up the opportunity. Later on, I found out that they were doing very well after I came across some ex-offenders who were featured in newspapers for their achievements.\" Outside of his work, CW Umaparen enjoys exercising and keeping himself fit. He works out at least 4 to 5 times a week! BehindPrisonWalls BeyondPrisonWall"

CW Nurhida Binte Buang, a Visit Centre Officer at Operations & Security Command, shared that it was her inquisitiveness that led her to join the Singapore Prison Services at the age of 22! Since then, she has never looked back and continues to pursue her calling to make a difference in the lives of those who are incarcerated. CW Nurhida is one of seven CaptainsOfLives who received the Outstanding Captains of Lives (OCOL) Award 2022! As a Visit Centre Officer, CW Nurhida ensures that visits for families of inmates are conducted smoothly. She also manages the programmes held at the various Prison Link Centres. Over the course of her meaningful career, she regularly interacts with inmates and their loved ones, offering words of encouragement and guidance. I feel a sense of achievement when I see ex-offenders being able to forge a new life for themselves. I tell inmates it will not be easy; they will fall many times and they need to continue to be resilient and pick themselves up while remembering the goal they set out to achieve. Aside from donning the hat of a Captain of Lives, CW Nurhida loves cycling, caf hopping and going to theme parks. One of her bucket list is to visit the various theme parks around the world!

These pleasant initial encounters gave me the impression that SPS is an organisation that provides opportunities and cares for the well-being of their staff. For her outstanding performance demonstrated during her training, SGT Chua received the Academic Studies Award and the Physical Fitness Award (Female).SGT Muhammad Rusdi Bin Badrit took a leap of faith to embark on a career as a Prison Officer after working nine years working in the audio and music industry, as he wanted to gain new experiences and knowledge that would let him make a positive contribution to the community. On how his impressions changed since becoming a Prison Officer, SGT Rusdi reflects, After my attachment in the correctional units, I realised the importance of the roles of Prison Officers in rehabilitating inmates. Beyond enforcing order and discipline, we must be mindful and humane in guiding inmates to influence them to become responsible citizens. For his excellent performance throughout his training, SGT Rusdi was conferred the Outstanding Trainee Award, Operational & Tactical Excellence Award, and the Physical Fitness Award (Male).

        "caption": "On 23 September 2022, the Singapore Prison Service (SPS) welcomed Prison Officers from Cohort 2-2021. They had successfully completed their training at the Singapore Prison Training Institute and recited the Prison Officers' Pledge during their Graduation Ceremony at the Home Team Academy! Following the footsteps of her father, SGT Chua Tandra joined SPS to inspire change in the lives of others. Under the Home Team Diploma Sponsorship Programme, SGT Chua previously had the opportunity to serve her internship with SPS Staff Development Division. She recounts, I have grown up around relatives who will now be my colleagues. These pleasant initial encounters gave me the impression that SPS is an organisation that provides opportunities and cares for the well-being of their staff. For her outstanding performance demonstrated during her training, SGT Chua received the Academic Studies Award and the Physical Fitness Award (Female).SGT Muhammad Rusdi Bin Badrit took a leap of faith to embark on a career as a Prison Officer after working nine years working in the audio and music industry, as he wanted to gain new experiences and knowledge that would let him make a positive contribution to the community. On how his impressions changed since becoming a Prison Officer, SGT Rusdi reflects, After my attachment in the correctional units, I realised the importance of the roles of Prison Officers in rehabilitating inmates. Beyond enforcing order and discipline, we must be mindful and humane in guiding inmates to influence them to become responsible citizens. For his excellent performance throughout his training, SGT Rusdi was conferred the Outstanding Trainee Award, Operational & Tactical Excellence Award, and the Physical Fitness Award (Male). Congratulations to our new Prison Officers aka CaptainsOfLives, as they embark on their careers enforcing the secure custody of inmates and rehabilitating them to become responsible citizens for a safer Singapore!

In my former role as the Institution Programme Officer in Institution A1, I oversaw the conduct of family programmes for inmates.

On her experience as a befriender, she recounts, I always listen to them and try to understand the issue from their perspective. As a befriender, my goal is to motivate the ex-offenders to break free from the mistakes of their past and build a positive relationship with their family and community.MCS also provides social services to ex-offenders such as assisting with referrals for financial or employment assistance, providing spiritual counselling and welfare aid for their families.By providing aftercare support to ex-offenders through the collaboration of SPS community partners and volunteers, we can break the cycle of offending and reoffending to keep Singapore safe and secure!CaptainsOfLives BehindPrisonWalls BeyondPrisonWalls"

As a CaptainOfLives, she has been given many opportunities to excel in her work and demonstrate her leadership abilities. Reflecting on her time being a woman in a male dominated workplace, Jervel shared, I feel comfortable working in SPS because Im treated as an equal among my peers.When I first found out that I was expecting twins, I spoke to my supervisor about the possibility of going on no-pay leave and they supported me. Such arrangement allows me to spend quality time with my children, watch them grow up and be there for them in their formative years.When asked if she has any advice for other working women, she said, For me, communication is key. Speak with your spouse at home to achieve a mutual understanding in caring for the children and handling the chores. Also seek support from your supervisors and colleagues at work. I am thankful that my working environment in SPS has helped me to achieve a work-life harmony.To all Mothers out there, we wish you a Happy Mothers Day! BehindPrisonWalls BeyondPrisonWalls"

        "caption": "Remember Khai from Inside Maximum Security? We caught up with him to find out how hes doing during the fasting month of Ramadan.For Muslims, Ramadan is not only about fasting - it is also about forgiveness, sacrifices and self-reflection to improve oneself spiritually. It is also where one spends time with their loved ones to eat pre-dawn meals and break their fast together.For Khai, this is the second year he is spending Ramadan in prison since his incarceration in December 2020. In the past, Khai would let his emotions control his actions, never stopping to think about the consequences. This eventually resulted in a series of incarcerations throughout his youth. It was only during his latest incarceration, shortly after the passing of his father, that Khai finally realised that he had to change. He recounts, Its been very challenging for me since my fathers passing just before I went into prison. Fasting for me these past two years feels empty without him and my family. He would often spend his days reflecting, reading the Quran and learning from other inmates who have also resolved to improve themselves spiritually.The thought of his mother and young daughter also keeps Khai inspired to change himself for the better, with the letters from them being a constant source of motivation for him.Just before he passed on, my father reminded me to take care of my mother upon my release from prison. He never gave up on me despite all my mistakes. If he believed I could still change, then I cant give up on myself too. I have to believe that I can be a better man.CaptainsOfLives BehindPrisonWalls BeyondPrisonWalls TransformingLivesWithYou"

In the past, Khai would let his emotions control his actions, never stopping to think about the consequences. This eventually resulted in a series of incarcerations throughout his youth. It was only during his latest incarceration, shortly after the passing of his father, that Khai finally realised that he had to change. He recounts, Its been very challenging for me since my fathers passing just before I went into prison. Fasting for me these past two years feels empty without him and my family. He would often spend his days reflecting, reading the Quran and learning from other inmates who have also resolved to improve themselves spiritually.The thought of his mother and young daughter also keeps Khai inspired to change himself for the better, with the letters from them being a constant source of motivation for him.Just before he passed on, my father reminded me to take care of my mother upon my release from prison.

We used to play badminton and hang out together after work.What started out as a friendship soon blossomed into a fulfilling marriage and partnership that has lasted over 30 years for our CaptainsOfLives, RO Charlvi Tan and ASP Toh Siew Choo.Suddenly, something changed, and I held her hand one day while crossing the street and here we are 30 years later, RO Tan recalled. Its definitely been an adventure, ASP Toh said. The good thing about being married to another Prison Officer is that you have someone who understands what youre going through. Were able to share our experiences, learn from each other, share our problems and come up with solutions together. Rising through the ranks together, the couple, who started as Junior Prison Officers and are now Senior Prison Officers, is grateful for the opportunities with the Singapore Prison Service (SPS).It feels nice to be recognised for your efforts, the father of two said. We always attend each others promotion ceremony to the point that our colleagues joke about meeting us at all ceremonies! Today, ASP Toh, is the OC Medical Centre of Institution A4, where she oversees and manages the prison operations of a Medical Centre in Institution A4. RO Tan is a Housing Unit Officer at Institution B2, where he oversees the daily operations in the housing unit with inmates pending Courts sentencing and instill order and discipline among them. Together with their team members, both ASP Toh and RO Tan always look for opportunities to motivate the inmates in their rehabilitation journey through the engagements during their daily prison operations.Whats the secret behind their everlasting love? Understanding and learning to trust one another is key, you must also give each other their personal space, moral support and lots of encouragement. Happy Valentines Day!

Her passion for volunteerism led her to join the Yellow Ribbon Community Project (YRCP) in 2011.For Ms Yogeswari, her time as a YRCP volunteer has been an eye-opening experience. During one of my first few visits years ago, I met the family member of an incarcerated inmate, she recalled. As we spoke, she suddenly broke down and cried. All I could do then was to provide a listening ear. Now with my social work experience, I can help them with their daily needs, and provide some psychosocial support.Reflecting on her journey, the grassroot leader for over 13 years is heartened to see more ex-offenders and their families receiving the support they need from the community. She feels inspired whenever she reads success stories of ex-offenders.On October 2021, Yogeswari was awarded the 10-Year Long Service Award at the Yellow Ribbon Community Project Awards & Appreciation 2021! She hopes that her efforts with the families of incarcerated inmates will continue to make a positive difference in their lives.BehindPrisonWalls BeyondPrisonWalls SG4SecondChances"

CW Leong was conferred the OCOL award because of his professionalism at work and for being an exemplary role model to those around him! CW Leong is a Work Programme Officer at Institution A5, where he oversees the day-to-day operations of the kitchen, as well as the deployment and training of inmate workers. During the onset of COVID-19 pandemic, CW Leong and his team were presented with many new and unexpected challenges. It was a time of uncertainty that required them to adapt and update their work processes to ensure safety for all the staff, inmates and volunteers. I was truly proud with the patience and perseverance shown by my colleagues. Over time, we adapted new practices and ensured that safety of inmates and staff continued to be our top priority. For CW Leong, being a CaptainOfLives means that the values he upholds while on duty continues to stay with him even after work. As leaders, I believe that we need to lead by example to inspire those around us, both in our professional and personal lives.

Eventually, his spirit of volunteerism led him to join the Yellow Ribbon Community Project (YRCP) under the Admiralty Division.YRCP is a grassroots-led initiative where trained volunteers visit families of inmates to offer them pro-social support and assistance to help minimise their burdens while their loved ones are incarcerated. Under the YRCP, Mr Wong helps families of inmates by assisting them with televisits at the ACE Community Centre in Admiralty, allowing inmates to chat with their loved ones through video conferencing. He also conducts home visits to help them with their daily needs.The passionate 68-year-old believes, People should help one another whenever possible. Life is not a bed of roses. There are also thorns. We must take life as it comes and be optimistic that good days will come.For his dedication and passion to help others, Mr Wong was named a YRCP Champion, and together with his team at Admiralty, they received the 10-Year Division Award at the Yellow Ribbon Community Project Awards & Appreciation 2021.With the close partnerships between our CaptainsOfLives and YRCP volunteers, our inmates will have a greater chance for successful reintegration into society and we can prevent inter-generational offending!BeyondPrisonWalls BehindPrisonWallsSG4SecondChances"

        "caption": "The Outstanding Captains of Lives (OCOL) Award is conferred to individuals who displayed professionalism in their work and are exemplary role models to those around them. Chief Warder (CW) Thomas Chow is one of the seven Captains of Lives conferred with the award. As a Programme Officer for Institution B5, a Drug Rehabilitation Centre (DRC), his primary duty includes planning and scheduling of programmes for DRC inmates. The programmes, which are based on the inmates assessed risks and needs, can include psychology-based correctional programmes, family programmes, employability skills training and religious programmes and services. Over the years, he has learnt that communication is key in making informed decisions. Knowing when to be firm, but also understanding when a more compassionate approach is needed to ease tensions among inmates, is a crucial skill as a CaptainOfLives. Thomas recounts, Theres an emotional side of the inmates which we dont normally hear or see. Once I escorted an inmate for a compassionate leave and saw how he teared because he wasnt around when his loved one passed on. Later, the inmate shared that he felt remorseful and regretted for what he did to end up being in prison. As a CaptainOfLives, Thomas derives a sense of satisfaction from helping inmates reintegrate into society by ensuring that they attend their rehabilitation programmes, and inculcating life skills and values to them so that they will be responsible citizens. During his off days, Thomas likes to keep fit and especially enjoys a game of badminton! CaptainsOfLives BehindPrisonWalls BeyondPrisonWalls"

A Lead Specialist at Psychological & Correctional Rehabilitation Division, Feng Ling works with a team of Correctional Rehabilitation Specialists to design, assess and implement rehabilitation programmes for inmates in prisons. She also works closely with Prison Officers to provide training and counselling support.I think appreciation comes in many forms if we know where to look. Sometimes it's a simple thank you, sometimes it's hearing a caseworker sharing what they learnt from our sessions. I recall a session where we were talking about strengths and an inmate mentioned \"Patience\", \"like how you showed us\" pointing towards me. This was a total aww moment for me because, the inmate had been very reserved and wanted to drop out of the sessions initially.Since that breakthrough with him, he has been actively participating in sessions, sharing his goals and opinions. It may not seem like much, but for me it was a huge win and it's moments like this that keeps me going.Outside of work, Feng Ling particularly enjoys reading through Reddit threads, often contributing content in the popular online forum herself!

DSP Tan is Officer-in-Charge (Training & Development) at Cluster C, where he leads a team in the planning and administration of training and well-being activities for staff in Cluster C. My motivation has always been to do something that makes a difference in the life of someone. You never know when you may touch someones life. In my role, it will be my colleagues and inmates. A simple Thank You keeps me going throughout my years in Singapore Prison Service and serves as a fuel for my journey here. DSP Tan also shares a little insight into his hobbies beyond the uniform. I like collecting foreign currencies when I go travelling. I am particularly fond of the Swedish Krona, as Sweden was the farthest place I had been in my travels.

One of the courses developed by SPTI is the Prison Officer Course, which is conducted for newly recruited Prison Officers.The Prison Officer Course incorporates correctional, scenario-based, physical and tactical skills training that enable Prison Officers to achieve SPS mission to enforce secure custody of inmates and rehabilitate them to be responsible citizens. All newly recruited officers must complete the Course before embarking on their foundational postings in the prisons.In 2020, SPS undertook a review of the Close Quarter Defence Techniques (CQDT). It is one of the tactical skills training taught to Prison Officers to use as one of the options to disengage an aggressive inmate and gain a safe separation. These defence techniques were subsequently refined to make them more intuitive to execute for all Prison Officers, regardless of their physical abilities. BehindPrisonWalls"

He was always intrigued with how SPS rehabilitates and eventually supports the reintegration of inmates into society to restart their lives on a positive note. RO Chan shares how empathy, care and concern are innate qualities of Prison Officers who are at the centre of the ripples of change for inmates under their charge. These qualities, according to RO Chan, affects all aspects of his life, and not just his profession.As a Staff Officer with the Provost Division, RO Chans job requires him to investigate disciplinary matters in SPS. Apart from his core duties, he is an active advocate for innovation, and is constantly looking out for ideas to streamline work processes at his workplace. A few months ago, he gave an opportunity to an intern who is differently abled to fix electrical works in his home although it took a longer time than a professional electrician. The intern had given his time and tried to learn a new set of skills. I thought it would be a good opportunity for him to put his skill sets to good use, said RO Chan. We should not shut the door on people who are hoping to be given a chance to prove their worth in society, especially when they have taken the first step to prepare themselves for new opportunities in life.CaptainsOfLives BehindPrisonWalls BeyondPrisonWalls"

When I was taken into custody, my wife shared that my son would call out my name in his sleep every night for the first few weeks, shared Nathan (pseudonym), a father of two, who has been incarcerated for five months. Due to their incarceration, inmates who are parents, like Nathan, are not able to be physically present with their children on Childrens Day.To foster healthy familial bonds and lessen the impact of incarceration on children of inmates, Singapore Prison Service works closely with community partners and volunteers to help inmates maintain meaningful bonds with their children. This also ensures that inmates return to supportive family networks upon their release, minimising the likelihood of re-offending.Today, however, as Nathan participates in a Childrens Day activity, he expresses hope for the future because he continues to maintain a strong relationship with his children. When asked about the first thing he would do upon release, his eyes lit up. Of course, to give my sons a very big hug! I cannot wait to hold them and never do things that will separate them from me again! BehindPrisonWalls HappyChildrensDay"

It was divided into two sections: Military Section and Civilian Section. The Military Section came under purview of the Judicial Department of the Southern Area Army.It was chosen due to its proximity to town and the nearby police barracks. The area had adequate land for new buildings and could also accommodate subsequent expansions.Throughout the years, Outram Prison went through various states of changes. In January 1937, its long-term prisoners were transferred to the new convict prison in Changi. Outram Prisons jail subsequently held offenders serving short sentences.In 1963, Outram Prison was demolished and its site was later redeveloped into a housing estate.SPS75 TransformingLivesWithYou CaptainsOfLives SPSHeritage"

The newly commissioned Prison Officers have gone through months of physical and tactical readiness training, as well as completed correctional training to prepare them for their journey as CaptainsOfLives in SPS.Over the course of their POC, the trainees also underwent residential and on-the-job training to enhance their prison craft competencies and prepare them for their roles in SPS to ensure secure custody of inmates and positively influence them in their rehabilitation journey.We spoke to RO Cynthia Lim and SGT Muhammad Norhidayat, the Outstanding Trainees for Prison Officer Cohort 2/20, who shared the highlights of their training with us.I found that I am now able to express myself better. Our training was not just physical training and combat, we also had classroom lessons where the trainers created a safe space for us to share our experiences, learnings, thoughts, and feelings. Through these sessions, I learnt to put thoughts into words clearly, which would be important when interacting with inmates, RO Cynthia Lim shared.Like RO Cynthia, SGT Muhammad Norhidayat found himself improving as an individual after completing his training course.The challenging PT sessions and the daily challenges set by the trainers taught me to always be prepared for any circumstances and have a strong mental resilience, said SGT Muhammad Horhidayat. Congratulations to all our new Prison Officers from Cohort 2/2020! BehindPrisonWallsBeyondPrisonWalls"

He also volunteers with the Yellow Ribbon Community Project in Woodlands Division and is also currently upgrading himself by pursuing a Diploma in Correctional & Management Studies.During my house visits, I always remind ex-offenders to never ever give up hope as there will always be a ray of light at the end of the tunnel. I also advise them that they should not be choosy when it comes to their first job after release if it meets their basic needs. There will always be other job opportunities, CW Ridzal opined.The 43-year-old officer believes that officers can be inspired from inmates too. He recalls an interaction with an inmate that prompted him to restart his own education journey. \"He (the inmate) told me one day that, Sir, if an inmate like me can restart my education at this age, you can too! His constant reminders, along with my colleagues and Commanding Officer's encouragement, led me to decide to finally take the plunge and get my Diploma!

As institutions were located in all parts of Singapore, travelling proved to be a pain point for some. The Kaki Bukit Centre Prison School, with its visionary philosophy of School First, Prison Second, was opened on 26 July 2000 by Mr Wong Kan Seng, then Minister for Home Affairs, with facilities comparable to the national schools. To prepare inmate students for their eventual reintegration to society, they were taught moral education and underwent social skills training to rebuild themselves holistically. By 2011, there were 40 teachers teaching GCE N, O and A levels, as well as courses certified by the Workforce Development Agency, and various vocational certifications. During the same year, the Kaki Bukit Centre Prison School moved to the former Tanah Merah Prison, where the prison school still remains today.SPS75 TransformingLivesWithYou CaptainsOfLives SPSHeritage HappyTeachersDay"

        "caption": "Good Morning Teacher! Meet Ms Shirley Ng, who teaches inmate-students the newly introduced Computer Applications course at the Prison School! The course was introduced as a subject to promote digital literacy and prepare inmate-students to be technologically ready upon their release.The former Ministry of Education (MOE) teacher shared that she joined the Prison School as an educator so that she can be part of the inmates rehabilitation journey. She believes that learning is a two-way street and has learnt the importance of perseverance, among other things, from inmates. Ms Ng shared the main difference between teaching in mainstream schools and Prison School, In mainstream schools, age profiles are pretty much consistent, but in Prison School, I have students from varied age brackets that range from 20s to 50s. My students learn and revise diligently, and their tenacity is paying off because I see them making progress and gaining confidence, she shared. An inmate-student once came up to me and shared that during his younger days, he could never concentrate and focus in class, but now thanks to my guidance, hes able to focus and progress on the course! It warmed my heart to hear this. SPS wishes all teachers a Happy Teachers Day!BehindPrisonWalls HappyTeachersDay"

He attended training sessions conducted by the Singapore Prison Service to prepare him for the work in the community as the competencies required to work in the prisons and community are different.CW Khairul was conferred the Outstanding Captains of Lives (OCOL) Award, which recognises individuals who displayed professionalism in their work and are role models to those around them. I always put in my best effort to persuade my supervisees to persevere and complete the programme, shared CW Khairul. During the course of working with them, I've also learnt soft skills that help me to communicate more effectively.\"CW Khairul is grateful to his team members and mentors in the MAS team, who have provided strong support and guidance to him. When not at work, CW Khairul enjoys watching Korean dramas. He shared that his favourite dramas are Mr Queen, Vincenzo, Taxi Driver and Sell Your Haunted House.

As a result, several Drug Rehabilitation Centres (DRCs) were set up very quickly to provide treatment and rehabilitation programmes to the drug addicts who were arrested and thereafter detained in the DRCs. The Sembawang DRC was opened in 1979 and could accommodate up to 1,000 inmates. The facility provided custodial care and rehabilitation to the drug inmates. In 2009, the facility ceased operations after its inmates were moved to Cluster B at the Changi Prison Complex. SPS75 TransformingLivesWithYou CaptainsOfLives SPSHeritage"

This scheme allowed inmates to re-adjust to the society and helped them secure employment before completing their sentences.Today, research shows that rehabilitation takes place best in a real-life environment.

The first of the seven recipients of the OCOL Award this year is ASP Ng Riying! ASP Riying, a Staff Officer at the Staff Development Division (SDD), oversees the posting of all civilian staff and junior officers. She works closely with the different clusters and departments to ensure that information for COVID-19 related operations are up to date and accurate. Besides that, she also organises dialogue sessions to provide CaptainsOfLives a platform to exchange their views and learn from one another. I find my work at SDD meaningful. The various postings allow our officers to be exposed to different work environments, that eventually chart the course of their careers within the Singapore Prison Service. ASP Riying revealed that the most challenging period for her was during the COVID-19 pandemic last year. I was new to my post and felt overwhelmed with the work and the changes around. What pulled me through was the support from my colleagues. They are the real giants here. Today, when I look back and see how much Ive grown, it is because of their support. Despite facing challenges in her new role, she believes in the power of teamwork, and has never once allowed work to overwhelm her. Its not all-work-and-no-play for the 36-year-old.

The low-to-medium security in SPC has the infrastructural capability to support rehabilitation and reintegration programmes, as well as provide vocational training opportunities for over 3,000 inmates and supervisees. Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Law, graced the opening ceremony of the SPC today and shared that the opening signals an important step in the transformation of prisons. Improvements in infrastructure, coupled with the considered use of technology, will help our officers and our community partners as they help offenders rehabilitate and reintegrate into society. In line with SPSs Prison Without Guards strategy, the development of SPC presents new opportunities to leverage technology for greater operational effectiveness and efficiency that enables not only prison officers but also inmates to be more focused on rehabilitation. Speaking of rehabilitation, Ms Chang Xin En, Correctional Rehabilitation Specialist at the Drug Rehabilitation Centre, shared that inmates learn to identify their unhealthy thinking patterns and how to correct them when they attend psychology-based correctional programmes. Practical life skills like communication and emotion regulation skills are also introduced to inmates. This will help them to build up a skill set that will help them to lead a drug-free lifestyle when they are released.SUPT Terence Ong Choon Teck, Superintendent of Institution S1 added on, Inmates face challenges in reintegration, such as maintaining employment and staying away from anti-social peers. Inmates who are motivated to change will benefit the most from the rehabilitation programmes offered to them. SPS will continue to work with our community partners such as halfway houses, volunteers and employers to provide inmates with structured support and supervision to prevent reoffending.BehindPrisonWalls BeyondPrisonWalls"

Through the therapeutic and self-reflective nature of art, inmate artists have learnt to express their penned-up thoughts and emotions in a positive manner, shared the prison staff of over 14 years.

This prestigious award is given to those Singapore Prison Service (SPS) staff who displayed professionalism in their work and are exemplary role models.Revealing that his curiosity about what goes behind prison walls was the main reason that motivated him to join the service, ASP Tan reminisced, I was given the privilege to be deployed in one of the Maximum Security Prisons the old Changi Prison. As a Singapore Prisons Emergency Action Response (SPEAR) officer, I had the opportunity to train with local elite Military and Law Enforcement Units, as well as attend study trips to Correctional Departments in Hong Kong, U.S.A and Australia. Looking back from where I started as a Sergeant to where I am today as a Housing Unit Officer (HUO) and a SPEAR detachment officer in Cluster C, my journey has truly been eye-opening thus far.ASP Tan reveals how he overcomes challenges and often finds them to be a blessing in disguise, It is all about getting past your comfort zone because the longer you stay there, the tougher it is to get out. I always tell myself that challenges and problems are opportunities to help us become better, not bitter.At the end of the day, ASP Tan is proud to be working in an organization that enforces the safe and secure custody of inmates and provides rehabilitation programmes for them.CaptainsofLives BehindPrisonWalls"

The most important thing is to keep an open mind and an open heart, and continue to learn and not to give up.Congratulations to all our new prison officers from Cohort 1/2020!

The Singapore Prison Service (SPS) encourages offenders to take greater ownership of their rehabilitation by leveraging on their families as a source of motivation for change.Adams turning point was the moment he realized his parents unwavering love for him. That was when he decided to pursue a goal to take up education in prisons. As a stark contrast to the past, Adam, who was barely interested in books when he was younger, requested for his parents to buy him reading materials whenever they visited him. To no surprise, the 27-year-old now has a Diploma in International Supply Chain Management and is currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in logistics and supply chain management.A piece of advice from Fatin to the family members of the incarcerated, Never give up on your children no matter what they have done. Our kids need the support of their parents in their reintegration journey. Throughout all these years, I have never missed any chance to visit my son, except once when I was sick and could not walk, Fatin gleamed.CaptainsofLivesBehindPrisonWalls"

Since SPEAR officers are the elite force within SPS, we asked CW Ang to share how he managed to sustain the tough training during the SPEAR Basic and Advanced Tactical course.CW Ang quipped, My greatest challenge was completing the 4-month SPEAR Basic and Advanced Tactical Course back in 1999. Although that was many years back, I still remember it very well. The course was very demanding, both physically and mentally, but none of us took the option of ringing the bell to give up. The tough challenge trained our persistence and mental resilience, and that is how I am still with SPEAR today.BehindPrisonWallsCaptainsofLives"

When we put on our uniform, it is always duty before ourselves. I never really feel limited just because I am a female. I feel challenges are how we perceive them. If we choose to believe that being a woman in a male-dominated environment is a limiting factor, then that thought will limit us and create obstacles for us. ?I wanted to join a profession that is of service and helps others. When you help an inmate, you not only help them but their family as well. Its a whole ripple of change. ?It was my professor who taught me during my Master's programme. His perseverance in putting his duty as a professor before himself stuck with me. It was that perseverance that anchored in my mind and I still tap on that in my job as a prison officer. ?Go for it! Its a very fulfilling job and youre not limited by your gender. There is no glass ceiling - as long as you have the right mindset, want to be at the center of facilitating change in individuals, and have a genuine interest in the job, you will excel!CaptainsofLives BehindPrisonWalls CelebratingSGwomen"

He eventually picked up the habit of abusing drugs as a way to cope with his negative emotions. In 2020, Ethan was arrested for drug-related offenses. This also meant that he had to give up his job in a law firm to serve his sentence. Ethan was assessed to be suitable to undergo the Community-Based Programme (CBP) where he was allowed to serve the tail-end of his sentence in the community. However, he had to abide by the conditions such as electronic tagging, curfew hours, and undergo regular sessions with his Reintegration Officer and Correctional Rehabilitation Specialist. Today, the 32-year-old is taking charge of his life and has decided to make amends for his past. My step-father said that everyone makes mistakes, but youve got to learn from your mistakes and not repeat them again. How many times do you want to go back to prison? His words ran through my mind repeatedly. Ethan also expressed his appreciation to his Reintegration Officer, CW Mariana Binte Karim and Correctional Rehabilitation Specialist, CW Sadhana Rai, who have helped him throughout his reintegration journey. I felt that the officers and counsellors were very helpful, steering me towards the right direction always, Ethan said. During my last week of incarceration, I received news that he (his step-father) was hospitalised with cancer. If it was not for the CBP, I would not have been able to see him one last time, Ethan uttered.As for his future plans, Ethan is looking forward to complete his Law Diploma followed by a degree and eventually move on to practise law. The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step, however (it has to be) in the right direction. My goal is to finish my studies and for that to happen, I have to stay out of trouble and to stay drug-free. CaptainsOfLives BeyondPrisonWalls SG4secondchances DrugsFreeSG"

He also encourages them to take ownership of their own rehabilitation through positive interactions. CW Abdul Hafiz was conferred with the Outstanding Captains of Lives Award (OCOL) in 2020, a prestigious award for Singapore Prison Service (SPS) staff who displayed professionalism in their work and are exemplary role models. Recalling an inmate under his care, CW Abdul Hafiz found out that the inmate had a poor relationship with his child, who did not visit or write to him during his incarceration. After several engagements with the inmate, CW Hafiz referred him to the Family Interventions and Reintegration Support Team (FIRST). At FIRST, case managers understood the needs of this inmate and his family and worked with them closely. Over time, their relationship improved and started showing positive results. This spurred the inmate to continue working towards strengthening the relationship with his child, and to turn over a new leaf for good.CW Abdul Hafiz also shared that at times, it can be quite disappointing to know that inmates under his charge have relapsed and are reincarcerated. However, he reminds himself that as long as he has given his best, there is no need to feel bad. You will never know when the little things that you do might be the stepping stone for an inmate to change. So keep trying.CaptainsofLives"

Beyond promoting an active lifestyle, ActiveSG hopes that the introduction of sporting activities can help our inmates to manage their emotions better, reflect on life lessons and build confidence in themselves. With the success of this pilot project, it strengthens our resolve to scale this programme to benefit more inmates together with SPS. - Chief ActiveSG, Sng Hock Lin."

This month, the spotlight is on OCOL Award recipient CW Charles S/O Pangkeas! As a Senior Personal Supervisor in Cluster B, CW Charles ensures the safe custody and discipline of inmates under his charge. His role also includes engaging inmates in meaningful interactions and providing guidance to help them break the cycle of re-offending. Being a person who enjoys challenges, CW Charles shared that he listens to the problems that inmates have and tries his best to help in any possible way. I would remind myself that every problem has a solution it depends on how you handle it. Solve the problem or leave the problem, do not live with the problem.When asked how he knows that this job is his calling, CW Charles recalled, I met an ex-offender while I was attending a church service with my family. He came over to introduce me to his family as a Prison Guardian Angel. I was at a loss for words, as I did not realise that I had made such a big impact in his transformation into a sincere and responsible family man. That was a memorable day for me as my children told me they admired me and my job as a CaptainsOfLives even more."

Guest of Honour, MOS Faishal also spoke on the topic of desistance, adding that, A society thats conducive for successful desistance can only be built up through the collective effort of the entire local correctional network. That is why it is important for every single one of our community partners and agencies to embrace desistance as a way of helping to rehabilitate and reintegrate our offenders in partnership with SPS and YRSG.Thank you to all who joined us in this session!

It helps to facilitate their reintegration back to a supportive family network upon release and mitigate their risks of re-offending.Mr Eruandee shared that the participating inmates are part of a larger programme where they learn soft skills such as learning how to listen to and speak with their children effectively. He opined that Mothers and fathers play a unique role in bringing up children. Activities like this will aid in providing familial bonds between parent-inmates and their children. When they are released, the bond helps sustain the relationship and hopefully, guide the child.Enhancing familial relationships is part of an important rehabilitation journey for our inmates as it reduces the impact of incarceration on their families, especially children, and therefore mitigate the risks of re-offending.

When they are released, the bond helps sustain the relationship and hopefully, guide the child.Enhancing familial relationships is part of an important rehabilitation journey for our inmates as it reduces the impact of incarceration on their families, especially children, and therefore mitigate the risks of re-offending.

The OCOL Award is a prestigious award for Singapore Prison Service (SPS) staff who displayed professionalism in their work and are exemplary role models.As an Admin & Personnel Officer at Operations & Security Command, CW Dennis Ho shared that he enjoys constantly coming up with new and innovative methods to understand inmates better and ultimately impressing change upon them. Our job involves helping inmates to change for the better, but change has to come from the inmates. There is no one-size-fits-all solution as inmates come from various backgrounds and they face different struggles. The challenge is understanding what would motivate them to make a change. The job is indeed rewarding!CW Dennis Ho recalled that there was once he saw an inmate having difficulties breathing and clutching his chest. He immediately called for an ambulance and together with his colleagues, carried him on a stretcher and rushed down a flight of stairs. The inmate eventually recovered and was extremely grateful to him. Its through little moments like this that make me feel my job is meaningful, and I actually have the ability to make a difference., shared the Captain of Lives.Thank you to CW Dennis Ho for your relentless pursuit to make a difference in the lives of offenders!

I provide group and individual interventions to inmates in Cluster B. Besides direct work with the inmates, I also work closely with prison officers to support individuals with behavioural and psychological issues in the housing units. The pandemic changed the way we work significantly. From going into the institutions in Changi Prison Complex (CPC) to conduct face-to-face assessments or intervention programmes for the inmates, to working predominantly from home when the Circuit Breaker was enforced. To ensure that our intervention programmes with the inmates will continue, my colleagues and I came together to produce videos for the psychology-based correctional programme for drug offenders, within three days! Besides that, I was also tasked to man the Virtual Family Assistance Centre (VFAC) along with my colleague Andre Paul, who is also a Correctional Rehabilitation Specialist. The VFAC was set up so that family members of inmates can call to enquire about the well-being of their incarcerated loved ones during the Circuit Breaker period. At the end of the day, I am proud to be able to be part of the VFAC team during the pandemic, where I assisted and reassured the family members of the inmates. As long as we stay united, we can overcome the COVID-19 pandemic together.CaptainsOfLives"

Making the decision to resume studies behind bars equips them with the academic qualifications to explore opportunities to pursue their dreams and lead a crime-free life after their release.

Good luck and all the very best for your upcoming exams!"

The OCOL Award is a prestigious award for SPS staff who displayed professionalism in their work and are exemplary role models. As a Correctional Rehabilitation Specialist at the Singapore Prison Service (SPS), she shared that her motivation in SPS was to help inmates become better sons, brothers or fathers to their families. She strongly believes that they can be better citizens and will be able to contribute back to society once they are back on the right path.Norain'ni quipped that it was not easy to work with resistant inmates who had little motivation to change. Id tell myself that change takes time, and this is not the time for us to give up hope but to push on. Working closely and sharing the struggles with the inmates Personal Supervisor helps in our intervention, she shared. She feels that all the efforts and hard work pay off when she chances upon ex-offenders who are out in the community and are doing well. Hearing about their progress and the positive impact on their families makes her feel that she has made the right career choice to be a Captain of Lives.Thank you Norainni for your hard work and dedication towards SPS and making a difference in the lives of the inmates and their families! Look out for the other OCOL award recipients and hear their stories!CaptainsofLives"

RPA is a great step for SPS towards digitalization to make our job more efficient so that we focus on other higher-value work. With the help of RPA, my colleagues and I have more time to communicate with the inmates, understand their challenges and identify resources to better address their needs. I am glad for the opportunity to impact the inmates lives and facilitate their change to become better citizens after their release from prisons.

The inmates look up to me not only as an art teacher, but also as their teacher in life.

I am also a direct mentor to one of the ex VAH inmates and am responsible for checking up on him from time to time and steering him in the right direction in life. Being a volunteer art teacher at the VAH is one of the most meaningful choice that I have made. Im grateful that I had the chance to listen to different life stories and play a part in the rehabilitation journey of the inmates. My ambition for the inmates is that they grow to become art and life mentors themselves. All of us come from different backgrounds, but we are able to stay connected through a common platform ART.

I am SUPT Cem Sim and this is my story on how my colleagues and I have contributed to the fight against COVID-19 in SPS.My team had to quickly gather requirements, procure handphone sets, sim cards and set them up within less than five hours after the cessation of visits between the inmates and their families was announced. The visit sessions were suspended during the Circuit Breaker period as part of our measures to prevent COVID-19 transmission in prisons. After the suspension, we explored alternatives to facilitate our inmates and their families to continue communicating with each other as they would be worried about their well-being during the Circuit Breaker period. We reviewed our operational processes and facilitated the five to ten-minute phone calls privileges for our inmates so that they could still communicate with their families during the Circuit Breaker period.One of the biggest challenges was finding a way to hold meetings virtually. The entire team rallied together and thats when I worked closely with SCW Ian Yeo, who helped to coordinate the technological support required for the staff at the Prisons Headquarters to work from home. With dedicated efforts from our staff who worked overtime, we were able to turn things around and set up VPN and video conferencing capabilities for our colleagues. It was personally fulfilling for me when we set up the video conferencing tools so that the inmates could still see their counsellors or teachers virtually and there would be no disruption in their rehabilitation programmes or school syllabuses. The use of technology plays an essential role in SPS, now more than ever. We are proud to have supported all our staff to ensure their day-to-day operations continue with no compromise in security and safety, and our inmates could continue with their rehabilitation journey.CaptainsOfLives SGUnited"

        "caption": "How does working in the Logistics Branch contribute to the fight against COVID-19? I am Supt Cheam Tiong Pheng. This is my story on how my colleagues and I have contributed to the fight against COVID-19 by supporting our frontliners to carry out their duties in a safe and timely manner. Due to the pandemic, our workload has increased as there is a surge in demand for items such as Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), and disinfectants. Our job ensures that our frontliners are always protected and that is the sense of purpose I derive from my role at Logistics Branch. On a day to day basis, we work closely with other support officers like CW Rose, who is the Team Leader (Estate Management) for one of the Clusters CW Rose and officers from other Clusters help us to coordinate the logistical support required on the ground. When the Circuit Breaker first started, it was exceptionally difficult. We were encouraged to work from home, but our jobs needed us to be physically present to ensure our frontliners have what they require. We then adopted a tele-commuting system and came down only to deliver supplies to the institutions. With coordination efforts from officers like CW Rose and her team, and the split team arrangement, we ensure the safety of our team members is not compromised. As the saying goes, \"alone we can do so little; together we can do so much. Logistics will always be a crucial part of ensuring the continuity of the great work our frontliners and ground staff do. If our frontliners are well equipped while on duty, we have helped to minimize the risk of COVID-19 outbreak in prisons. It is exciting to be part of a dynamic work environment - nothing feels better than providing support to our frontline officers to carry out their duties to protect the safety of our inmates and inspire them to become responsible citizens. Stay tuned to a series of stories featuring our CaptainsofLives who have carried out their duties diligently behind the scenes to support our frontliners in the battle against COVID-19!"

CaptainsofLives wishes all fathers, especially those who are braving the frontlines in the fight against COVID-19 - a HappyFathersDay! Meet Muhammad Syafiie Bin Imran, a first-time father, who works as a Reception Operations Officer in Cluster B with the Singapore Prison Service (SPS).

Being a frontline officer and now a new dad, I am not only responsible for my safety, but also safety of the inmates, my colleagues, and ultimately my family. Its a huge responsibility to protect the safety of our inmates and colleagues we need to strictly adhere to every process and measure put in place to minimize the risk of COVID-19 transmissions in prisons. I take my job seriously as any lapse in the work process could have a dire consequence. Thus, I understand the position taken by SPS to be gradual and cautious in easing and lifting any measures even though Phase 2 of Singapores reopening has started.Initially, my wife was concerned about my safety as well as the safety of our eight-month old son. After I shared with her on all the precautionary and safety measures at my workplace, she now feels more assured and confident of my safety. Becoming a father has definitely spurred me to be a better role model, not just to my son but also to the inmates. I try to put myself in the shoes of the inmates to understand them better.By listening to their life stories and giving them encouragement, I hope that it will motivate them to kick-start their rehabilitation journey.Both my wife and I want our son to grow up as a curious and adventurous learner. We believe that he will learn best through the exposure to nature and exploration of the world around him. For now, my wife and I are grateful for the health of my son. Stay safe everyone!"

As an Officer-in-Charge of a Housing Unit comprising about 400 inmates, my team and I manage inmates awaiting trials, and it has been challenging but yet rewarding. Some inmates felt lost and thought that life was over when they were admitted to prisons. I see it as my responsibility to engage and help them look for opportunities to turn over a new leaf while waiting for the outcomes of their trials. Those who heeded my advice became more settled in prisons and demonstrated positive behaviors.Then COVID-19 came into the picture! It has made my job even more demanding. As CaptainsofLives, we are frontliners working hard to prevent an outbreak in prisons. Many precautionary measures had to be put in place to ensure the safety of our staff and inmates.To be honest, it has not been easy. This pandemic has disrupted not just our day-to-day life but also the operational routines in prisons. Being nimble, agile, and vigilant at all times has helped us cope with the situation to keep our prisons safe and secure. Its not just the safety of our inmates or colleagues we are responsible for, but also our families we return to at the end of our long day at work. When my family found out that I had to work during the Circuit Breaker period, they were extremely supportive and that kept me motivated.Its always been duty before self. Once the crisis is over, I am looking forward to a celebration with my family and my teammates, who have been supportive and giving their best for the past few months.Together, we will overcome COVID-19!

Syarifah confided, its not easy to be in an essential service at this moment, but my kids are my motivation. They always remind me to wear my mask and be safe. They also make it a point to say, Mama, Im proud of you and that really keeps me going. Juggling between her long hours at work and having kids at home is challenging but she shared her secret on what keeps her family bonded during these times. Once she reaches home, she makes a point to gather her kids and chat about their days while enjoying some food. No topics are out of bounds and it's moments like these that are sacred to her and make her feel her sacrifices are worth it in the end. Over the past 17 years, Ive had inmates confiding in me and I try my best to provide a listening ear to them. Being a mum of four, I do that all the time at home too, so its not new to me. I feel that supporting inmates at every step of their rehabilitation journey is so important because it gives them hope for a better future. We salute all Mothers around the world, and especially those who are working hard to keep Singapore safe and secure during these unprecedented times. Thank you and we wish you a happy MothersDay!SGUnited SPSUnited"

Over a decade ago, they bumped into each other in a lift at the same HDB block they live in and today, theyve been happily married for 9 years!When asked about how its like working together within the Singapore Prison Service, Joann said, I think its great because not many people understand the line of work we do and to have someone who understands what I'm going through I am grateful for that, as we are able to share and learn from each other.\" Even though their paths crossed at work, Cleve says, \"We are able to remain professional and deconflict. We do not mix work and personal matters when we are together.\" Akin to any other couples, ValentinesDay celebrations are a yearly ritual! This year, a simple dinner date after work is in the works for this couple, as they believe that the company is what matters! We cant help but agree whether your significant other is from work or elsewhere, have a Happy Valentines' Day!"

For example, some staff will be detailed beyond their working hours to help supervise the issuance of medication. Some daily routines are changed to accommodate the Muslim inmates who are fasting,\" explains RO Faizal. \"The lights and water are turned on earlier and turned off later so that inmates can have their pre-dawn meals and prayers. The kitchen staff also have to start prepping dinner earlier for Muslim inmates who are breaking fast in the evening. CaptainsOfLives Photo: Muhamad Darwisy Haroon"

More than 800 inmates have participated in various rehabilitative art programmes at the Visual Arts Hub since its inception in 2007. Inmates with good conduct, have a keen interest in art and committed to their rehabilitation can apply for the three-month long programme where they will be exposed to subjects such as batik painting, pottery and acrylic painting. These programmes aim to nurture the artistic potential, encourage creative insights and facilitate positive change in the mindset. Ultimately, art can help ex-offenders unlock their potential in employment, education and eventual reintegration into society. BehindPrisonWalls"

We spoke to her on how her sacrifices and those of other CaptainsOfLives keep Singapore safe while everyone else is on holiday. RO 1 Ng Kia Yi: I was looking for a job that was less desk-bound, something that gives me the opportunity to interact with others. Being a uniformed officer, I was always prepared to have to work on CNY if necessary. Hence, I guess I did not feel as bummed about missing out on part of CNY. Colleagues of other races are always willing to swap shifts or cover their Chinese colleagues. We try our best to allow our colleagues to have the PH off to celebrate their festive holiday. Working on CNY will mean that I will miss out on some gatherings and meals with my family and friends. However, I am thankful that my family and friends are understanding enough and are willing to work around my work schedule to accommodate me.\"BehindPrisonWalls CaptainsOfLives"

There were so many challenges attending to them and trying to understand them. I remember feeling disheartened at times and questioned myself if I could perform well for SPS. I had so much to learn since I was a young, inexperienced officer. Fortunately, I was very thankful to have colleagues who guided and motivated me and ensured that I carried out my basic jailcraft as a Prison Officer dutifully. Fast forward 10 years to today and I am still in A4! But this time around, I am managing women offenders which come with its own set of challenges. Ive learnt so much in the past 10 years and really feel Ive become a thinking officer while instilling fairness in my duties. I hope that I will continue serving SPS for the next 10 years as I believe it will be an exciting story to tell in 2029 especially now that we are moving towards Transformational Environment.

        "caption": "\"Volunteers are a positive source of influence that inmates and ex-offenders can turn to upon their release or if they need help,\" said Superintendent (SUPT) Valerie Chiang, who is also the Senior Assistant Director of the Community & Family Policy Branch.She shared that volunteers come from all walks of life including secular and religious groups, and play an important role in supporting our initiatives and rehabilitation. \"Volunteers really value-add to the rehabilitative efforts that SPS is putting in as pro-social support is something that is very important and isn't readily available. Community partners such as Volunteer Welfare Organisations and SPS befrienders offer a source of positive influence that these inmates can turn to upon their release. By meeting people who can journey with them, this positive influence can lead inmates to the path of the straight and narrow. \" she said. While we believe that inmates need to take charge of their own rehabilitation, prison volunteers and community partners also play a vital role in supporting inmates rehabilitation and reintegration into society. This helps us in our vision of a society without re-offending.CaptainsofLives BeyondPrisonWalls"

        "caption": "To tackle the over-representation in crime and drug statistics of the Malay-Muslim community, the Development and Reintegration Programme for Malay-Muslim inmates was developed by the Singapore Prison Service in collaboration with the Association of Muslim Professionals (AMP). The programme provides interventions for Malay-Muslim inmates in the Drug Rehabilitation Centres and their families, for a period of up to 12 months after the inmates' release. Despite not having experience in aftercare work, AMP rose to the challenge by recruiting and training case workers to work closely with inmates and their families to address their reintegration needs.AMP spokesperson, Mdm Hameet Khanee J Hussain, a senior manager at AMP who heads the social services division, said: One of AMPs core focuses is to empower the underprivileged and help them to take charge of their lives. By offering a holistic intervention and addressing the concerns the inmate has while he is incarcerated, he can then focus on his rehabilitation and reintegration journey. The Malay-Muslim population in prison is disproportionally high and we must, as a community, come forward to lead and to support them in their reintegration and rehabilitation needsBeyondPrisonWalls CaptainsOfLives"

Through this course, student inmates will gain relevant knowledge and skills in both international supply chain and business management to support these industries. \"We do believe in education and life-long learning\", SUPT Goh said. \"This course enables the students to find better jobs upon their release and gives them a seamless transition to the community.\"CaptainsOfLives BehindPrisonWalls"

Themed Creating Ripples of Change at Every Level, topics such as Youth Criminal Conduct and Substance Abuse Treatment, Families and Incarceration, and Offender Rehabilitation and Community Corrections will be discussed by a variety of industry professionals at the conference. These include psychologists and Correctional Rehabilitation Specialists (CRS) from the Singapore Prison Service, the Central Narcotics Bureau, Ministry of Social and Family Development, as well as aftercare professionals from Singapore Anti-Narcotics Association and Trybe. We spoke to Dr Gabriel Ong, Chairperson, YR Conference and Principal Psychologist with the Singapore Prison Service. Dr Ong shared that he would assess the risk of inmates and recommend suitable programmes to change their attitude. The inmates will then be able to weigh the pros and cons of their actions and this will increase their motivation to change.Dr Ong emphasized on the importance of employer and community support in the rehabilitation journey of ex-offenders. The ex-offenders need to practice the skills they acquired in prison in a natural environment, for instance, their workplace, Dr Gabriel Ong, Chairperson, YR Conference.When asked what he hoped to achieve from this conference, Dr Ong mentioned that he hopes to be inspired by the best practices of the world and share the Singapore Prison Services correctional policy with leaders all over the world.CaptainsofLives BeyondPrisonWalls"

For example, they can purchase canteen items from a vending machine automatically, and also engage in self-learning on tablets. The test-bedding of technology in A4 has also allowed our prison officers to be more than just guards. They can be Captains of Lives mentors, coaches and role models to inmates, guiding them to become contributing members of society when they leave prison. says SUPT 1A Angeline Chua of Institution A4, which houses over 1,000 female inmates. As the Second Superintendent, SUPT Angeline oversees the smooth running of operations at Institution A4.Institution A4 has demonstrated how technology can transform the way our prisons are run. A key benefit of introducing these technologies would be to improve the work of a prison officer many routine and manual processes would be eradicated, enabling the officers to focus on purposeful interactions to better manage the inmates and facilitate their rehabilitation.SUPT Angeline continues to feel inspired as a Captain of Lives and she continues to be driven by the motivation of making an impact on the lives of inmates and their families.

He was awarded the Excellent Service Award (EXSA) Silver, Gold and Star award and has received numerous Thank You cards from inmates whom he impacted deeply over the 11 years he has been with the Singapore Prison Service..He shared that one of his most memorable moments was when he recently came across an ex-offender who was previously under his charge. The ex-offender thanked him for his advice to think of his family whenever he felt he was about to re-offend. He added that this had driven the ex-offender to change for the better and that his family would never have to go through the ordeal of waiting for him to be released from prison again..As Prison Officers, the way that you communicate with your supervisees is important as they will hold on to your words, said SSGT Mohamad. It may be a simple word of encouragement, but you never know how much of an impact it will have on them..BehindPrisonWalls BeyondPrisonWalls OurCOLture"

Thus far, she has had two memorable experiences of interacting with inmates..First was when a female inmate became disenchanted with life and kept to herself all the time as her family did not contact her. Min Shen took the time to sit down with the inmate and understand her issues before she opened up. After many sessions with the inmate, she slowly changed her outlook on life, worked hard and regained her families acceptance..The second was when Min Shen was in charge of a male inmate who would push away her attempts to engage. Despite him having a tough outer shell, Min Shen sat through many sessions with him and finally gained his trust. The inmate shared his feelings and how he was worried about his mothers ailing health. In the end, a case was put up and social workers visited and assisted his mother..Captains of Lives like Min Shen not only positively impact the lives of inmates and their successful reintegration but also that of their families..BehindPrisonWalls BeyondPrisonWalls OurCOLture"

Other than personal determination, Mr William credits his change to support from prison officers and volunteers whom he now considers his mentors..Having been out of the prison system for 12 years, Mr William gives back and seeks to create impact by giving inspirational talks to inmates under a volunteering programme..When I was in prison, I made peace with myself to accept peoples reactions to ex-offenders. I cannot change how they react but I can change how I react. Prison was a good training ground for me to manage myself he shared..Accepting his calling, Mr William feels that his life has led him to pass down what he has learnt and experienced so that youths can learn from him. He added, With my faith, I have come to the realisation that I should make an effort to reach out to the younger ones [inmates] who can still be positively influenced.

It is about being there for them and walking with them, he shared.Mr Zuraimi shared that such programmes are useful in allowing the community to further support and advocate rehabilitative initiatives for inmates and ex-offenders.

These volunteers also help many ex-offenders ease back into society through emotional and social support.When asked for his most memorable experience in his 10 years of service, DSP Azhar recounts how he met a male inmate who had been in prison for quite a while. The inmate shared that, Im not getting any younger and Ive learnt a lot in prison. When I am released, I hope to find a decent job as I am not well educated. I have a good set of hands for labour. Fast forwarding a few years later, DSP Azhar bumped into the same inmate again, this time driving a delivery truck for a fast food restaurant. As they caught up, DSP Azhar could not help but feel proud of how the ex-offender had turned his life around.As Captains of Lives, we take the lead in providing guidance to those under our charge and work with the community to successfully rehabilitate inmates so they can become contributing members of society.BehindPrisonWalls BeyondPrisonWalls ourCOLture"

Being a part of the run for so many years, SUPT Chan shared fond memories of the first run. She shares that running side by side with ex-offenders sends the message that they are not alone. As vice-chairperson she shared her thoughts on the new category this year - Run for Second Chances Movement which consists of teams of four, symbolising how it takes many helping hands to support each ex-offenders rehabilitative journey. She also shared how the category was also opened to public registration so as to increase opportunities for the community to come together for the run and show their support for ex-offenders. Second chances can come from anyone and we as Captains of Lives should be the first to lead by example.ourCOLtureBehindPrisonWallsBeyondPrisonWalls"

By equipping our officers with the technological edge, this would allow our officers to be freed up from guarding duties so that they can engage in higher order work, such as information analysis and rehabilitative interactions with inmates, said Director of Transformation and Technology, SAC Koh Tong Hai.In time, as technology plays an increasingly bigger role in SPS, the role of a prison officer will also evolve. With more quality and purposeful interactions with inmates, prison officers will be able to better rehabilitate them and in turn uphold a safe and secure prison system.BehindPrisonWalls PrisonWithoutGuards EvCOLution"

Guest of honour, Parliamentary Secretary for Home Affairs Amrin Amin, congratulated award winners at the event yesterday, adding: No matter what your personal circumstances may be, with positive goals, determination and the right attitude, you can accomplish many things in life. More than 1,600 inmates have participated in the NYAA programme since the Singapore Prison Service has implemented it in 2000. The programme aims to encourage young inmates to develop personal qualities of self-reliance, perseverance and a sense of responsibility not only to themselves but also to the community. Through embarking on the different components that were held within CWP and TMP, participants are able to gain greater awareness of their roles in society and learn how their skills, talent and knowledge can contribute towards the community. Kudos to our NYAA award recipients this year who have done us proud! BehindPrisonWalls"

After graduating from university with a finance degree and working briefly as a relief teacher, SUPT 1 Kalaivanan joined the Singapore Prison Service (SPS) in 1997 as a prison officer, bringing the spirit of innovation and quick thinking with him.SUPT 1 Kalaivanan attributes all this to his boss, who gave his full support to their initiative. My boss gave me the autonomy to lead my innovation team, and regularly joined our meetings to lend his support.Looking back on his 20-year career, SUPT 1 Kalaivanan is thankful for the role models that supported innovation and helped to create a positive workplace as SPS underwent its own transformation.

He understands the importance of being a role model for the inmates as it would create a positive change in their behaviour.He shared that there was a time when he was approached by an inmate who showed an interest in body building and fitness. CW Irwan Kurniawan shared his knowledge with the inmate and encouraged him to pursue fitness as an interest. A few years later, CW Irwan was approached by a man dressed in sports attire while shopping. He initially thought that the man was trying to sell him a gym package, only to realize that it was the inmate that he had spoken to years ago. As they chatted, the inmate thanked CW Irwan for giving him direction in life, mentioning that he had inspired him not just by words, but also being a role model that he could follow in life. At this juncture, I realized that as Captains of Lives (COL), our words can really make a long lasting impact on an inmates life, he shared. As long as we take pride in our work and always strive to maintain our professionalism, we will unknowingly end up becoming someones role model. BehindPrisonWalls BeyondPrisonWalls OurCOLture"

Since young, Miss Lee had always wanted to be a police officer. However, she stopped schooling due to family issues. After working for 12 years, her hopes were renewed when she was offered an opportunity to pursue her studies again at the National Taiwan Normal University. I felt that this was a second chance given to me. When I was in Taiwan, I told myself that if I cant be a police officer, then Ill be a counsellor, she said.After completing her Bachelors Degree in Chinese language, Miss Lee returned to Singapore and was determined to achieve something in her life. Starting off as a religious counsellor, she eventually pursued a teaching career at various schools, subsequently volunteering her time at the Tanah Merah Prison School. As long as they are willing to do their work, Im willing to grade their assignment and go through their mistakes with them, says Miss Lee.Her motivation to stay as a tutor even after 10 years lies within the learning attitude of her students. Her students take their work seriously and will even ask her for assignments. This has spurred her to put in her utmost effort in order to help them. As someone who understands the meaning of second chances intimately, Ms Lee shares a strong bond of empathy with her students, who are able to wholeheartedly share their troubles with her.Volunteers play a vital role in creating an impact on the successful rehabilitation and reintegration of inmates and ex-offenders. They can create a more inclusive and safer society by providing pro-social support to inmates and ex-offenders."

Despite the challenges faced in both her personal and professional life, Ms Wang displayed commendable perseverance and vigilance in her work, allowed her to receive this sponsorship.With this award, Ms Wang would now be able to fulfil her wish to further pursue her studies, which will empower her with skills and knowledge that would prove invaluable in her work.

That is where Community Rehabilitation Specialists like Ms Katherine Peh come in. She recently shared with us her experiences working with offenders and at-risk youths. Prior to joining SPS, I often wondered if there were opportunities for prison staff to connect with the offenders in therapeutic ways, with a focus to motivate and facilitate their change.That opportunity came when I joined the Singapore Prison Service (SPS), with officers journeying with offenders in the aftercare phase. Working in the Community Rehabilitation Centre (CRC), I fostered therapeutic relationships with youths through motivational sharings, and by showing genuine concern for their well-being I was able to build rapport with the youths, facilitating change. Connecting with offenders in a therapeutic way has also significantly transformed the way I work. I continued to apply this useful way of connecting with the offenders. For example, when a supervisee attends an aftercare counselling session and has concerns about his unstable accommodation, it is important to listen and attend to his accommodation needs, before working with him on potential ways to resolve the issue. Once the connection is made, I am then able to assess and address his needs to help him not re-offend again. BehindTheBadge"

In order to qualify as a contestant, ASP Raizaluddin shared that one has to first register their interest before undergoing a stringent selection round. Following that, they would have to engage in weekly trainings to prepare for the events. Some of the challenges ASP Raizaluddin faced while training were the long training hours, incorporating physical and tactical trainings as well as being able to find a common time where each participant could train together as a team. With conflicting schedules in their shifts, training still went on even in the middle of the day when the sun is hottest. Despite the obstacles faced, ASP Raizaluddin learnt a lot from his experience. He shared that one of his key takeaways APLC is to Always be prepared, and to expect the unexpected; scenarios can change in various ways but the most important thing is to be ready when it happens.

As COS/SPS, Shies duties include overseeing strategic research, planning efforts and the development of staff units. Some of the Home Team's future training initiatives would involve extending prison officers' work to go beyond the prison walls and into the community, which will allow officers to further develop their capabilities and skills towards facilitating the successful rehabilitation and reintegration of offenders back into society.COS/SPS Shie was also part of the team who brainstormed the vision for SPS, which came to be \"Captains of Lives\", which focuses on ensuring the safe and secure custody of inmates, as well as rehabilitating them for a safer Singapore."

We dont judge, we listen and we help.

Upon closely monitoring their personal conduct, attitudes towards reintegration and conducting a thorough risks-and-needs assessment, inmates who are at the tail-end of their sentences may be placed under the home detention, halfway house or work release schemes; all of which exemplify the importance for inmates to be productive members of society.Under each scheme, the inmates would have to adhere to strict regulations, such as electronic tagging, curfew hours as well as regularly reporting to their Reintegration Officers on their progress.Mr Rockey described the CBP as a concerted effort which encourages inmates to remain crime-free: The CBP enables SPS officers to work very closely with correctional specialists, aftercare agencies, as well as families of inmates, in unison, to provide inmates with the support that they need to rehabilitate.

Through the support and affirmation from her superiors, colleagues and husband, she decided to enroll in a Bachelors Degree course in Criminology and Security at the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT)Before taking up the course, CW Hannahs primary duties involved collaborating with key personnel on the planning, implementing and scheduling of inmates in-care and pre-release programmes.In taking up this course, she hopes to gain a deeper level of understanding of the different aspects of criminology, as well as to hone her critical thinking skills.Even though she acknowledges the challenges of juggling studies and family, she advises officers to manage their time wisely, keep a positive mind-set and adopt a never give up attitude.We would like to wish all SPS officers furthering their education the best of luck!

SUPT Ng added that one of the greatest highlights for her was being able to see how art has helped transform the lives of the inmate artists in little ways. Art is indeed a great way for inmates to express themselves when words will not suffice. It also helps the inmates to learn more about themselves, look positively ahead and gain hope for the future.

Today, we give you a sneak peek into our very own Singapore Prisons Emergency Action Response (SPEAR) force; the elite, tactical response force of SPS and the less lethal weaponry used.To ensure that the SPEAR officers are competent to handle any possible prison contingency, they do not only go through a prolonged selection process, but also on-going trainings to ensure they are well-versed with SPS operations at all times. Additionally, they are trained in the use of several less lethal weapons, which aid them in the handling of prison contingencies.One example of the less lethal weapon used primarily by the SPEAR force is the FN 303 Less Lethal Launcher, a semiautomatic shoulder fired launcher, which uses compressed air to launch projectiles. The FN 303 is constructed from durable lightweight polymer with comfortable ergonomics and is equipped with both flip-up iron sights and C-more sight for fast target acquisition.Do remember to click on COL50Things to read more feature stories about the Singapore Prison Service."

Some volunteers have helped provide religious counselling and guidance during the offenders incarceration, while others have volunteered as befrienders, providing the much-needed friendship and social and emotional support for offenders before and after their release he adds.To find out more about the roles of volunteers and the volunteering opportunities available at the Singapore Prison Service, do visit:"

Throughout his three years volunteering with SPS, Mr Azman has worked with inmates from all walks of life, providing them with the counsel and emotional support that they need, to help them be better prepared for potential challenges that they might face after their release.When asked what keeps him going as a volunteer, Mr Azman replied, When I see the inmates that I work with change for the better, I am inspired to continue the work that I do with them."

Having started his career as a prison officer in 1957, Mr. Muthu was involved in the setting up of the first drug rehabilitation centre, Selarang Park DRC. Despite the limited resources, Mr. Muthu understood the importance of infrastructure planning to eliminate security threats and staff management. He did his best to support his subordinates by caring for their well-being, as well as training them so that they could perform better at work. Through his dedication and perseverance, Mr. Muthu became the first Assistant Director in charge of all the Drug Rehabilitation Centres, from which he retired at age 53 in 1986.

The drive towards positive change should not only start upon an inmates release but during their incarceration she added. Thus, as a prison officer, she understands the multiple roles that she has to take on to see that change happen."

This year, a total of 96 inmates qualified for the NYAA awards, after having completed several non-competitive activities, which were centered on helping them develop personal qualities of self-reliance, perseverance and a sense of responsibility not only to themselves, but to society and the nation as well.The Singapore Prison Service is committed to providing inmates with the support and opportunities needed for them to rehabilitate, so that they can break out from the cycle of re-offending and be contributors to society.
